# Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for Time Series Forecasting

This github repository contains the codes and scripts to generate the results of the numerical experiments reported in [1], where we introduce a novel methodologyto forecast several time series with non-negative entries, based on low-rank decompositions and matrix completion. We refer the interest reader to [1], for the theoretical analysis of the algorithms, referring in particular to statistical guarantees on uniqueness and robustness of the solutions.
